Blockchain is the technology the underpins digital currency (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and the like). The tech allows digital information to be distributed, but not copied. That means each individual piece of data can only have one owner.

With a blockchain, many people can write entries into a record of information, and a community of users can control how the record of information is amended and updated. Likewise, Wikipedia entries are not the product of a single publisher. No one person controls the information.

Most of the appeal towards blockchain technology revolves around four themes associated with its key features. Loosely they are:

1.) Lower transfer & interaction fees: Blockchain platforms are preserved by their users, without the need for other parties, which radically reduces lots of the fees associated with transactions.

2.)A high degree of security & trust: Blockchain technology takes away the necessity for third-parties and its decentralised nature would have major benefits in conditions for enhancing trust. 

3.)A high degree of openness, transparency and dependability: The blockchain ledger is open and can be looked at by any person, so any system predicated on an open public blockchain platform is very translucent; any person can easily see all trade-flows. The shutting down of any computer will not lead to loss of information.

4.) Integrating the digital and physical world: Blockchain technology offers a way of representing nearly every asset, whether it be tangible or intangible.
