Pay-Per-Click (PPC)
PPC is a method of driving traffic to your website by paying a publisher every time your ad is clicked. One of the most common types of PPC is Google AdWords, which allows you to pay for top slots on Google's search engine results pages at a price "per click" of the links you place. Other channels where you can use PPC include:

1.)Paid ads on Facebook.
2.)Promoted Tweets on Twitter.
3.)Sponsored Messages on LinkedIn.
