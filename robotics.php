                        <p class="color-2">Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.<br/>

These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

                        <p class="color-2">1.)Military robots.<br><br>

2.)Industrial robots. Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s). According to the Robotic Industries Association US data, in 2016 automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales.<br><br>

3.)Medical robots of various types (such as da Vinci Surgical System and Hospi).<br><br>

4.)Construction robots. Construction robots can be separated into three types: traditional robots, robotic arm, and robotic exoskeleton.<br><br>

5.)Cleanup of contaminated areas, such as toxic waste or nuclear facilities.
